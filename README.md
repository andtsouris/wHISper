## **Challenge 1:** *VoiceMed*: The Voice-Controlled Clinical Assistant


### 🔍 Problem Statement:
In hospitals, interacting with Hospital Information Systems (HIS) is often complex, time-consuming, and requires manual data entry via keyboard and mouse. This issue leads to significant administrative overhead for medical staff, which consumes valuable time that is lost from direct patient care.

### 🎯 The Challenge:
How might we use Artificial Intelligence, particularly language models (LLMs) and speech recognition, to radically simplify interaction with the HIS?

## 💡 Our solution:
We developed a hands-free, voice-controlled clinical assistant that enables a fast, seamless and natural interaction between medical staff and the Hospital Information System.
